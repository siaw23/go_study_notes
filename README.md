# Go Programming Language Study Notes
These are personal notes taken from [Get Programming with Go](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-go), a well thought out book by Nathan Youngman and Roger Pepp√©. I highly recommend you buy the book for a real learning experience.

I intend to add more notes from different sources. This might end up being extensive.

[These](https://github.com/siaw23/go_study_notes/blob/main/notes.md) are notes I took for my references and revision.
