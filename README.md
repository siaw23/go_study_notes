# Go Programming Language Study Notes

These are personal notes taken from [several resources](https://github.com/siaw23/go_study_notes/blob/main/resources.md).
I intend to add more notes from different sources. This _might_ end up being extensive.

[These](https://github.com/siaw23/go_study_notes/blob/main/notes.md) are notes I took for my references and revision.
